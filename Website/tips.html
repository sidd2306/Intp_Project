      <h1 class="tipstart">Some basic cooking tips everyone should follow</h1>
          <p class="tiptitle">Tips On Cutting & Peeling :</p>
          <ul type="bullet">
          <li>Wash vegetables before peeling or cutting to preserve the water soluble vitamins.</li>
          <li>If you boil vegetables in water, do not throw the water, keep it to make gravies.</li>
          <li>To avoid browning of apples after cutting, apply a little lemon juice on the cut surface. The apples will stay and look fresh for a longer time.</li>
          <li>After peeling onions cut in half and soak in water for about 10 minutes before cutting to avoid crying.</li>
          <li> Wrap the fruits and vegetables in newspaper before refrigerating to keep them fresh for long.</li></ul>
    
          <p class="tiptitle">Tips On Frying :</p>
<ul type="bullet">
  <li>To start, choose your cooking oil carefully.</li> 
  <li>Heat the oil thoroughly before adding seasonings or vegetables.</li>
  <li>Heat a non-stick pan and add a little more butter than usual. Now beat the egg and stir briskly (even while frying) with a fork. This way more air goes in your omelet, making it light and fluffy. Fry till done and serve hot.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the food you're going to fry is dry. Let it sit on paper towels for some time after done frying</li>
  <li>Don't overcrowd the pan! Carefully add the food, leaving lots of space around each piece so the food will cook evenly. If you add too much food at once, the oil temperature will drop and the food will absorb fat instead of instantly searing.</li></ul>
   
          <p class="tiptitle">Tips For Gravies:</p>
<ul type="bullet">
<li>Always use ghee or vanaspathi with or instead of oil, which gives a good flavour to the gravy. </li>
<li>Fry the ground masala in reduced flame, so that it retains its colour and taste.</li>
<li> To retain colour in the gravy always use ripe red tomatoes. Discard green portions if any.</li>
<li>Good variety chillies and chilli powder also gives colour to the gravy. As far as pos sible try to use long variety red chillies. </li>
<li>While using ginger and garlic paste in curries, always use garlic at 60% ratio and ginger at 40% as ginger is very strong and may make your dish sharp and pungent.</li></ul>

          <p class="tiptitle">Tips On Cooking :</p>
          <ul type="bullet">
<li>To make 1 cup of dal, add atleast 2-3 cups of water, depending on the type of dal.</li>
<li>Soak whole pulses overnight and other dals for one hour before cooking.</li>
<li>Always add hot water to the gravy to enhance the taste.</li>
<li>Chop some extra vegetables, for next day stir fry.</li>
<li>Never discard water in which vegetables are cooked, use it in gravies, soups or rasam.</li>
<li>While boiling milk, always add a little water at the base of the vessel to avoid the milk from sticking at the bottom.</li>
<li>Add a tsp. of hot oil to homemade pastes of garlic, ginger or green chili, along with salt to make it last longer and taste fresher.</li>
<li>Add a few drops of lemon a tsp of oil to rice before boiling to separate each grain.</li>
<li>Never discard the water in which vegetables are cooked, use it in gravies or soups.</li>
<li>Immediately after boiling noodles put them in normal cold water to separate them each.</li></ul>


          <p class="tiptitle">Tips On Leftover Food:</p>
<ul type="bullet">
<li>If you are making pasta or rice, cook some extra and store in refrigerator for the next meal.</li>
<li>Keep some boiled potatoes in fridge, to make quick sandwiches for breakfast.</li>
<li>Use left over rice for next day meal, use your imagination and cook something new.</li>
<li>Keep some extra dough in fridge to make chapatis for breakfast.</li>
<li>Use leftover sukhi dal to make stuffed paratha.</li></ul>

   <p class="tiptitle"> General Tips For Cooking Non-Vegetarian:</p>
   <ul type="bullet">
   <li>When you cook chicken or meat, you should first cook over high heat to seal juices and then lower the heat and cook till tender</li>
<li>If you want to store fish for more than a day, first clean it, rub it with salt, turmeric and maybe, a dash of vinegar, and then freeze. It will stay fresh.</li>
<li>Don't salt meat before you cook it. The salt forces the juices out and impedes browning. Instead, salt meat halfway through cooking, then taste when the meat is done and adjust the salt as needed.</li>
<li>Meat that is partially frozen is much easier to cut or slice.</li>
<li>Allow meat to stand at room temperature 1 hour before cooking: It will cook more quickly, brown more evenly, and stick less when pan-fried.</li>
<li>To help keep meats moist during a long grill or barbecue, add a pan of water close to the fire, but away from the meatTo avoid kebabs from becoming hard and chewy, marinate them for a longer time and avoid over cooking them.</li>
<li>To get rid of the smell of prawns, apply salt and lemon juice to the prawns before cooking. Leave for 15-20 minutes, then wash off and proceed with the recipe. This is usually done with prawns, fish and al kinds of seafood.</li>
